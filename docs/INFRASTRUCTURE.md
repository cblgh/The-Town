# Infrastructure

In an effort to be transparent and in the spirit of collaboration, this document outlines the infrastructure and recurring cost of the [Town of Merveilles](https://merveilles.town).

## Server
Merveilles.town is an instance of **[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) version 2.6.5** that is on a virtual private server (VPS) hosted on **[DigitalOcean](http://digitalocean.com/)**. The VPS is hosted in **DigitalOcean**'s `FRA1` region, located in Frankfurt, Germany. It is a manual install, done by going through the [installation instructions](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/administration/installation/) outlined in the [documentation](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/). The VPS operating system is **64-bit [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) version 18.10**, created using **DigitalOcean**'s one-click install. To see the tools powering **Mastodon**, you can reference its [GitHub Page](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon).

## Assets
All images, videos, and other files you can upload to the instance are hosted on **[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)**. The bucket (the location containing all assets) is hosted in the `eu-central-1` region, also located in Frankfurt, Germany.

## Emails
Email notifications sent from `notifications@email.merveilles.town`, used for password resets and the like, are sent through **[Sparkpost](https://www.sparkpost.com/)**.

## Domain Registration
The [merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town) domain is registered through **[Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com/)** and is set to automatically renew before the registration expires.

# Cost
| Resource | Cost | Reference | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| DigitalOcean | **USD$24** per month | [https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/) | Droplets can be cheap, but Mastodon specifically needs at least 4Gb of memory to compile assets. I also have weekly backups enabled, which costs an extra 20% of the droplet cost. |
| Dreamhost Registration | **USD$34.99** per year | [https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/domain-registration-terms/](https://www.dreamhost.com/legal/domain-registration-terms/) | The `.town` top-level domain (TLD) is a bit more expensive to register than other TLDs. |
| Amazon S3 | **Varies** per month | [https://aws.amazon.com/free/](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) | The instance is currently on the free tier of S3, but you only pay as much as you use, which is based on the number of variables. |
| Fastmail | **USD$5** per month | [https://www.fastmail.com/pricing/](https://www.fastmail.com/pricing/) | We need to have the Standard tier so that we can use our own domain. |
| Sparkpost | **Varies** per month | [https://www.sparkpost.com/pricing/](https://www.sparkpost.com/pricing/) |  The free tier of SparkPost allows for 15000 emails sent per month, which we should be able to comfortably stay below with a smaller number of users. |

## Total Cost
At least **USD$26.92 per month**. This cost can be higher based on how much resources the instance uses.
