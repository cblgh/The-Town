# The-Town

Resources for the [Town of Merveilles](https://merveilles.town).

### Get in Touch

- [Somnius](https://merveilles.town/@somnius)
- [Devine Lu Linvega](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire)

## Instance Values

We chose to align ourselves with that of the #solarpunk movement.

- A demand for technology and society to re-center around sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy.

- A focus on decentralization, community activism, social justice, and civic empowerment.

- A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply interconnected.

## Invite Only

We want to keep the instance small. The aim of the Town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created by members of the Merveilles community. To cover for hosting and maintenance, we suggest making [a donation](https://ko-fi.com/somnius) to allow for [Somnius](https://merveilles.town/@somnius) to dedicate time to keeping the instance working. Any surplus will be used to improve the platform and give back to the underlying projects.
