# The-Town

Resources for the [Town of Merveilles](https://merveilles.town).

### Get in Touch

- [Somnius](https://merveilles.town/@somnius)
- [Devine Lu Linvega](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire)

## Instance Values

We chose to align ourselves with that of the #solarpunk movement.

- A demand for technology and society to re-center around sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy.

- A focus on decentralization, community activism, social justice, and civic empowerment.

- A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply interconnected.

## Invite Only

We want to keep the instance small. The aim of the Town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created by members of the Merveilles community. To cover for hosting and maintenance, we suggest making [a donation](https://www.patreon.com/merveillestown) to allow for [Somnius](https://merveilles.town/@somnius) to dedicate time to keeping the instance working. Any surplus will be used to improve the platform and give back to the underlying projects.

### Introduction

Upon joining the instance, we recommend that you write a first entry using the `#introduction` tag, that generally describes who you are. You should also consider pinning this to your profile.

### Cross-posting

For the time being, you are not allowed to automatically cross-post from other social networks. If it's found that you don't respond to cross-posted interactions on the instance, you will be considered as lurking and will be removed. 

### Meat

On this instance, we adopt non-speciesist values and keep our local timeline free of animal cruelty. We do not allow pictures of dead animals on our public timeline.

### NSFW

NSFW content is permitted, but only under certain conditions:

- Put your post under a Content Warning.
- Include "nsfw" in the text of the Content Warning.

Posts promoting certain types of problematic content are explicitly not allowed, including:

- Bestiality (any sexualized depiction of non-cognizant animals)
  - _Clarification_: Explicit furry art, or depictions of anthropomorphized animals who have the mental capacity to consent, is allowed. However, depictions (and especially photography) of animals who cannot consent is not allowed at all. If capacity to consent is unclear, removal of a piece of content will be left to the administrators.

- Pedophilia (or any sexualized depiction of children or young animals)

### Blocked Domains

Merveilles.town restricts content from some domains. This instance is intended to be a quiet, peaceful place to work on projects. To keep it that way, we restrict content from domains that go against our rules and Code of Conduct preemptively. Please refer to the [blocklist](https://github.com/merveilles/The-Town/blob/master/docs/DOMAIN_BLOCKS.md) to see the full list.
