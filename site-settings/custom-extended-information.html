<h2 id="instancevalues">Instance Values</h2>

<p>We chose to align ourselves with that of the solarpunk movement.</p>

<ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
<li><p>A demand for technology and society to re-centre around sustainability, longevity, and balance with an emphasis on renewable energy.</p></li>

<li><p>A focus on decentralisation, community activism, social justice, and civic empowerment.</p></li>

<li><p>A recognition that economic, social, and ecological injustices are all deeply inter-connected.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inviteonly">Invite Only</h2>

<p>We want to keep the instance small, the aim of the Town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created by members of the Merveilles community. To cover for hosting and maintenance, we suggest making <a href="https://ko-fi.com/somnius">a donation</a> to allow for <a href="https://merveilles.town/@somnius">Somnius</a> to dedicate time to keeping the instance working. Any surplus will be used to improve the platform and give back to the underlying projects.</p>

<h1 id="merveillesconduct">Merveilles Conduct</h1>

<h2 id="ourantiharassmentpolicy">Our Anti-Harassment Policy</h2>

<p>Merveilles is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to all Merveilles spaces, including the slack channel, repositories, and at local events, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the <a href="https://github.com/merveilles/Resources">moderators</a>.</p>

<p>Some Merveilles spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, moderators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Merveilles spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Merveilles members or the general public.</p>

<h3 id="harassmentincludes">Harassment includes</h3>

<ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">

<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>

<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “<em>hug</em>” or “<em>backrub</em>”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>

<li>Threats of violence.</li>

<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>

<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>

<li>Stalking or following.</li>

<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>

<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>

<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>

<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>

<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>

<li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>

<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li>

<li>Merveilles prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Moderators reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding:


<ul>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>

<li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>

<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

<p>If you are being harassed by a member of Merveilles, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the moderators at <a href="mailto:meow@somni.us">meow@somni.us</a> and <a href="mailto:aliceffekt@gmail.com">aliceffekt@gmail.com</a>. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to Merveilles spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Merveilles outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from Merveilles based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Merveilles spaces and behavior towards people who are not in Merveilles.</p>

<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. It may be deemed necessary&mdash;for the protection of individuals outside our community or of the reputation of the community&mdash;to identify offenders of this Code to persons external to this community (including, where necessary, in public forum). We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct is an evolving document. If you see something missing that you'd like to add, please make a pull request at its <a href="https://github.com/merveilles/Resources/blob/master/CONDUCT.md">GitHub Page</a>.</p>
