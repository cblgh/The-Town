# How to install

This will set our theme as the default and the one that is used publicly.

Copy `merveilles.scss` to `app/javascript/styles/merveilles.scss`

Copy `themes.yml` to `config/themes.yml`

Copy `en.yml` to `config/locales/en.yml`

To have this take effect you will need to rebuild the webpack assets on the server then restart the application.
